            <p><a href="/payments/elements">Stripe Elements</a> is a set of pre-built UI components for
                building your checkout flow and is available as a feature of Stripe.js.
                Elements provides ready-made UI components like inputs and buttons for
                collecting information from the user. Stripe.js then tokenizes the sensitive
                information within an Element without ever having it touch your server.</p>
